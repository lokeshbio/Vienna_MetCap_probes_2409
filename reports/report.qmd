# Practical information

## Data responsibilities
Unfortunately, NBIS does not have resources to keep any files associated with
the support request; we kindly suggest that you safely store the results
delivered by us. In addition, we kindly ask that you remove the files from
UPPMAX/UPPNEX. The main storage at UPPNEX is optimized for high-speed and
parallel access, which makes it expensive and not the right place for long-term
archiving. Please be considerate of your fellow researchers by not taking up
this expensive space.

The responsibility for data archiving lies with universities and we recommend
asking your local IT for support with long-term data storage. The
[Data Center](`r link_data_center`) at SciLifeLab may also be
of help with discussing other options.

Please note that special considerations may apply to human-derived, sensitive
personal data. This should be handled according to specific laws and
regulations as outlined at the [SciLifeLab website](`r link_sensitive_data`).

## Acknowledgements
If you are presenting the results in a paper, at a workshop or at a conference,
we kindly remind you to acknowledge us according to the signed
[NBIS User Agreement](`r link_agreement`):

Please acknowledge NBIS like so: *Support by NBIS (National
Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) is gratefully acknowledged.*

NBIS staff should also be included as co-authors if the
support work leads to a publication and when this is merited in accordance to
the ethical recommendations for authorship, *i.e.* the [ICMJE
recommendations](`r link_authorship`). If applicable, please include
*`r params$staff_name`, `r affil`* as co-author. 

In addition, Uppmax kindly asks you to [acknowledge UPPMAX and
NAISS](`r link_uppmax`). If applicable, please add: *The computations/
data handling/[SIMILAR] were/was enabled by resources in project 
`r params$uppmax_project` provided by the National Academic Infrastructure for 
Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS) at UPPMAX, funded by the Swedish Research 
Council through grant agreement no. 2022-06725*

In any and all publications based on data from NGI Sweden, the authors
must [acknowledge SciLifeLab, NGI, VR and UPPMAX](`r link_acknowledge`).

## Closing procedures
You should soon be contacted by one of our managers with a request to close down 
the project in our internal system and for invoicing matters. If we do not hear 
from you within **30 days** the project will be automatically closed and invoice
sent. Again, we would like to remind you about data responsibility and
acknowledgements, see the sections on data responsibilities and
acknowledgments.

You are naturally more than welcome to come back to us with further data
analysis request at any time via [the support form](`r link_support`). Thank
you for using NBIS, we wish you the best of luck with your future research!
